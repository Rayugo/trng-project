# trng-project

## Overview

This project implements a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) and demonstrates the creation and verification of a digital signature using the RSA algorithm. The implementation leverages the Crypto++ library to perform cryptographic operations. The project aims to provide a clear example of generating a digital signature with RSA keys, ensuring data integrity and authenticity. 

The TRNG was based on article "Generating True Random Numbers Based on Multicore CPU Using Race Conditions and Chaotic Maps" by Je Sen Teh, Moatsum Alawida and Azman Samsudin.

The code was sucessfully build on Visual Studio 2022.
